## AI Feature Specifications

### 1. AI-Powered Inspection Scheduling

**Problem Statement:**
Manual scheduling is time-consuming and prone to oversight. Inspections are often scheduled at fixed intervals without considering equipment usage, location risk, or historical patterns.

**Solution:**
Machine learning model that optimizes inspection schedules based on:
- Equipment age and type
- Location risk factors
- Historical failure rates
- Weather patterns (for outdoor extinguishers)
- Building occupancy patterns
- Technician availability and route optimization

**Implementation Approach:**
```
1. Data Collection Phase (Months 1-3)
   - Collect inspection history
   - Track deficiency patterns
   - Monitor equipment lifespan
   - Record environmental factors

2. Model Training Phase (Months 3-6)
   - Train classification model (failure risk)
   - Train regression model (optimal inspection interval)
   - Use features:
     - Equipment age
     - Last inspection date
     - Deficiency history
     - Location type
     - Manufacturer
     - Capacity
     - Environmental factors (indoor/outdoor, temperature)

3. Deployment Phase (Month 6+)
   - Real-time schedule recommendations
   - Auto-adjust inspection intervals
   - Predict high-risk equipment
   - Optimize technician routes
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Reduce unnecessary inspections by 20-30%
- Catch 95%+ of potential failures before they occur
- Optimize technician routes (reduce travel time by 15-25%)

**Technology Stack:**
- Python for model training (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Azure Machine Learning for hosting
- Real-time inference via API
- .NET integration layer

### 2. AI Risk Prediction & Anomaly Detection

**Problem Statement:**
Inspectors miss subtle patterns that indicate imminent failure. Reactive maintenance is more expensive than proactive intervention.

**Solution:**
Anomaly detection system that identifies extinguishers needing extra attention:

**Risk Factors Analyzed:**
1. **Equipment Characteristics**
   - Age (older = higher risk)
   - Type (some types fail more often)
   - Manufacturer (quality variance)
   - Capacity (larger units have more points of failure)

2. **Environmental Factors**
   - Location type (harsh environments = higher risk)
   - Temperature extremes
   - Humidity levels
   - Exposure to chemicals/corrosion

3. **Historical Patterns**
   - Deficiency frequency
   - Pressure loss trends
   - Physical damage history
   - Replacement part frequency

4. **Inspection Patterns**
   - Time since last inspection
   - Failed inspections count
   - Corrective action completion rate
   - Technician notes sentiment analysis

**Implementation:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for risk scoring

def calculate_risk_score(extinguisher):
    score = 0

    # Age factor (0-30 points)
    age_years = (today - extinguisher.manufacture_date).years
    score += min(age_years * 2, 30)

    # Deficiency history (0-25 points)
    deficiency_count = extinguisher.deficiencies.count()
    score += min(deficiency_count * 5, 25)

    # Pressure loss pattern (0-20 points)
    if detect_pressure_trend_decline(extinguisher):
        score += 20

    # Environmental factors (0-15 points)
    if extinguisher.location.type in ['outdoor', 'harsh']:
        score += 10
    if extinguisher.location.high_humidity:
        score += 5

    # Time since last inspection (0-10 points)
    days_overdue = (today - extinguisher.next_inspection_date).days
    score += min(days_overdue / 30 * 10, 10)

    return min(score, 100)  # Cap at 100

# Risk levels:
# 0-25: Low risk (green)
# 26-50: Medium risk (yellow)
# 51-75: High risk (orange)
# 76-100: Critical risk (red)
```

**Alerts & Actions:**
- **High Risk (75+):** Immediate inspection required
- **Medium Risk (50-74):** Schedule within 7 days
- **Pattern Detected:** Email alert to admin with details

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Heat map of facility showing risk levels
- List of top 10 highest-risk extinguishers
- Trend graphs showing risk over time
- Recommended action items
