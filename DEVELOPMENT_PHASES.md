## Risk Management

### Phase 1 Risks:
- **Mobile compatibility issues** ‚Üí Mitigation: Test on multiple devices early
- **Offline sync complexity** ‚Üí Mitigation: Use proven libraries (Dexie.js)
- **GPS accuracy problems** ‚Üí Mitigation: Allow manual override

### Phase 2 Risks:
- **QuickBooks API changes** ‚Üí Mitigation: Monitor API changelog, have fallback
- **Email deliverability** ‚Üí Mitigation: Use reputable service (SendGrid)
- **Customer adoption** ‚Üí Mitigation: Excellent onboarding, free trial

### Phase 3 Risks:
- **Insufficient training data** ‚Üí Mitigation: Start with 100+ inspections minimum
- **Model accuracy** ‚Üí Mitigation: A/B test AI vs. manual scheduling
- **Cost of AI infrastructure** ‚Üí Mitigation: Use serverless (Azure Functions)

### Phase 4 Risks:
- **App Store rejection** ‚Üí Mitigation: Follow guidelines strictly, use TestFlight
- **Native app development timeline** ‚Üí Mitigation: Consider React Native if falling behind
- **Platform-specific bugs** ‚Üí Mitigation: Thorough testing on both platforms

### Phase 5 Risks:
- **Enterprise sales cycle** ‚Üí Mitigation: Start enterprise conversations early
